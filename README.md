### Hi there, I'm Eric Bradley and I am an aspiring Buisiness Intelligence Analyst. ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eric, an aspiring Business Intelligence Analyst with experience on 6 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, story telling, SQL, Power-BI, Tableau, and advanced spreadsheets. I'm eager to leverage my skills in big data and visualizations to drive growth and boost sales.

Currently, I am working in healthcare as a Medical Laboratory Technician and I am transitioning to a career in data. My experience as a MLT has built a foundation of diligent and careful communication skills in addition to meticulous attention to detail. In 2023, I enrolled and completed the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics bootcamp. The curriculum covered advanced spreadsheets, SQL, visualization technologies (power-bi, tableau), and more. It also involved several technical projects.

Some facts about me:
- I am a dedicated family man and father to a beautiful little girl. (Proud GirlDad)
- I enjoy extreme dieting and exercise routines to test my discipline (maybe it's the veteran in me :man_shrugging:)
- My only passion besides data and my family is jiujitsu :muscle: 
- My goal in 2024 is to land my dream job as a BI Analyst
